I'm a political economist working on the politics of social policy. I am particularly interested in the dynamics behind health inequalities and their repercussions. I am currently a Max Weber Fellow at the European University Institute.

I received my PhD from Central European University in September 2019. My dissertation looked at how clientelism and partisanship influenced access to healthcare in 17 Eastern and Southern E.U. member states.
